# Revelation-ExistanceV1

# Created By Visualized Studios

  This is a survival game. Collect resources, loot, and kill others to obtain more loot and conquer the Island. This game is single player for now but we plan to add a player to player connection to others. This will not be on steam but will probably end up on a website we make in the future to distribute the full game once released.
